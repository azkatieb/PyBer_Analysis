# **PyBer Analysis Module 5 Challenge**

## **Overview of PyBer Analysis**
V.Isualize has requested a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and then using that data, it was asked that we create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. From the last analysis, we broke down the data by driver, fares and rides by city type but this time we are narrowing down the data and getting the fares by week and then by city type. This data will then be used by PyBer leaders to make decisions.

## **Results**

When comparing the three city types, as expected, Urban cities utilized the most rides, followed by Suburban cities and lastly Rural cities. Given that the population in Urban areas are the most densely populated, it would make sense that they have the most people to not only utilize the ride shares but also have more people to be drivers which would allow the utilization to increase. The total drivers and Total Fares follow the same pattern as the total rides with Urban being first followed by Suburban and then Rural. When it comes to Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver the order is reversed. In rural areas, people will need to travel longer distances to get from one place to another which would increase the total fare that each of them would pay because they are paying by the mile. Drivers would get a higher total fare in a rural area because they are having to drive longer distances whereas in Urban areas, the distances are much shorter and fares would be less. When looking at the table of the breakdown by weekly fares they follow the same trends at the overall breakdown. The graph shows the same trends and we also see on the weeks were rides increased or decreases, they increased or decrease at about the same amount across the city types.

## **Summary**

Based on the results of the data, I would recommend to the CEO that the following be addressed:
- The fares by city type are evaluated to ensure they take into account the average distances that each ride takes in the various city types. The average fare per ride between Rural and Urban is only about $10 but I would gather that the average total distances of each ride would span are much larger difference between the two.
- I would also recommend that the demand in each city type be evaluated againist the number of drivers to ensure that there are enough drivers in each of the city types. With the right number of drivers this would help the demand and rates to match and some rates not being increased because their is too much demand and not enough drivers. 
- Lastly, because demand in the Rural and Suburban areas are not as much as the Urban areas, could the company flex the drivers into different city areas to keep up with the demand when some areas have lower demand to allow the company to better meet customer demand.
